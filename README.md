# How to run

There are two different modes of running. One for development with all the beauty of quarkus hot reloading and one using
kubernetes.

## Development with Quarkus hot-reloading

Make sure you have a RabbitMQ container running. You can either use the provided run configuration (*rabbitmq*) or run
this command:

```shell
$ docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management
```

This will expose the AMQP port (5672) as well as the RabbitMQ management console (15672).

Now you can start the Quarkus application using the provided run configuration (*quarkus*) or this command:

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

## Kubernetes

This is done using minikube and kubectl. You can also use Docker Desktop or any other kubernetes cluster for it.

1. Start minikube:

```shell
 minikube start
```

2. Point your terminal to use Minikube's Docker daemon (this needs to be done in each new terminal window you want to build images in):

```shell
 eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

3. Build your Quarkus application image in Minikube's environment (from project root):

```shell
 docker build -t quarkus-app:latest .
```

4. Apply the Kubernetes configurations (development):

```shell
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/development/
```

5. Check if everything is starting up properly:

```shell
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

6. Wait for all pods to show "Running" status. You can watch them with:

```shell
kubectl get pods --watch
```

7. To access your services, get the URLs:

```shell
minikube service rabbitmq --url
minikube service quarkus-app --url
```

When you're done working and want to shut everything down:

```shell
kubectl delete -k kubernetes/ .
minikube stop
```

To deploy production environment:

```shell
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/production
```
